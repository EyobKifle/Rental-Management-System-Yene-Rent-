# TODO: Fix Analytics Page Charts with Mock Data

## Tasks
- [ ] Update `Js/api.js` to use comprehensive mock data from `Js/mock-data.js` instead of limited demo data
- [ ] Modify `Js/mock-data.js` to ensure payments for recent months are marked as 'Paid' and generate data for last 6 months
- [ ] Adjust default date filter in `Js/analytics.js` to cover the last 6 months
- [ ] Test analytics page to ensure all charts (Profit & Loss, Income by Property, Expense Breakdown) populate with data
- [ ] Verify tables and stats display correctly with mock data

# TODO: Add Login/Get Started Buttons to Dropdown in Mobile/Tablet Mode

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Edit `Html/header-public.html` to move `nav-actions` inside `nav-links` so buttons appear in the mobile dropdown menu.
- [x] Update `Css/publicstyles.css` media queries to hide `nav-links` by default up to 992px and show on `.active` class for dropdown behavior in mobile and tablet modes.
- [x] Test the changes by running the site locally and verifying the dropdown includes the buttons in mobile and tablet views.
